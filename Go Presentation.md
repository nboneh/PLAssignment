Overview
========

* Google Go
* Difference between Arrays and Slices
* Slice Syntax Proposal
* Impact and Uses

Google Go
=========

* Introduced in 2009 BY GOOGLE
* Created by Rob Pike
* Statically-typed, Garbage Collected, Compiled
* Goal to Create a Better C

Arrays in Go
============

* Arrays are Primitive Values

```
	b := [2]int{42, 47}
```


```
	b := [...]string{"fourtytwo", "fourtyseven"}
```

Introduction to Slices
======================

* First introduced in Fortran 57
* A way to interact with partitions of arrays
* Less common these days


Slices
======

* Common Use: Extracting a Substring from a String
* e.g. "ell" from "hello"

Slices in Go
============

* Slice Syntax Declaration

```
letters := []string{"a", "b", "c", "d"}
```


```
func make([]T, len, cap) []T
```

Slices in Go
============

Slices in Go
============

Slices in Go
============

* To Construct a Slice from an Existing Slice
* a[i:j]
* The index of the Slice is i
* The length is j - i

Slices in Go
============

```
b := []byte{'g', 'o', 'l', 'a', 'n', 'g'}
```


```
// b[:2] == []byte{'g', 'o'}
// b[2:] == []byte{'l', 'a', 'n', 'g'}
// b[:] == b
```

Slices in Go
============

```
s = s[2:4]
```

Capacity of Slices
==================

```
s = s[:cap(s)]
```

Proposal
========


* Proposed by Russ Cox
* a[i : j : k]
* The index of the Slice is i
* The length is j - i
* The capacity is k - i

Proposal Explained
==================


* Allows Construction of a new Slice from an Existing Slice with a Lower Capacity

```
x = make([]int, 10, 20)
// x[0:10:15] == make([]int, 10, 15)
```

Implications
============

* Gives the Programmer more Control over Slices
* Language does not feel complete without it

Syntax Concerns
===============

* Confusing Syntax

> "The syntax s[a:b:c] seems a bit confusing to me. [a:b] can easily be translated to "from a to b" while the semantics of [a:b:c] wouldn't be that obvious. I think even more problematic is [a::b]. For one thing it could easily be missed, like gri pointed out, for another thing :: has a special meaning in many other languages." - Julien Schmidt

Syntax Addressed
================

* There is no real solution for the confusing syntax
* Although it is not necessary to include the third element of the slice
* In other words, backwords compatible.

Alias Concerns
==============
* Lose the ability to compare two slices and see if they share memory
* Previously slices would compare the last element of two slices

> "People keep talking about "alias" but I'm not convinced that's the concept we're losing. What we're losing is the ability to tell if two slices reside in the same underlying array. The ability to change the capacity of a slice makes aliasing a dynamic property, but sharing an array remains a static one, and perhaps the more important and, after this change, harder to compute. I can always compute 'aliasing' by comparing addresses, but after a capacity change there is no unsafe-free way to discover if two slices *could* share memory." - Rob Pike

* Rob Pike states that you can test if two slices point to the same array
extending the slices to the capacity and then checking the last element.

Alias Addressed
===============
* This was addressed this on the mailing list
* The test was rarely used practice
* it is not as important as the feature


* Rob Pike addresses the issue by stating that in practice, this test is not
widely used

> "I donâ€™t see a compelling argument that overlap testing is important enough to warrant language support beyond package unsafe. If that argument is made, we could consider it then." -Rob Pike

Overview
========

* In the grand scheme of things, this change was not very important to
language
* The entire reason as to why this was implemented in the first place
was to satisfy a specific instance where you would need to change the
capacity
* There is no reason to leave out functionality in a programming language
